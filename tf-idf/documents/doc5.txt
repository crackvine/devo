Keyboard Cat is a video-based internet meme. Its original form was a video originally made in 1984 by Charlie Schmidt of his cat Fatso seemingly playing a musical keyboard (though manipulated by Schmidt off-camera) to a cheery tune. While Schmidt had uploaded the video himself to YouTube in 2007, Brad O'Farrell, with Schmidt's permission, appended the video to the end of a blooper video uploaded in 2009 as if to have the cat "play" the person offstage after the gaffe as they had done in Vaudeville. The idea of this quickly expanded on the Internet by numerous other users, typically under the name "Play Him Off, Keyboard Cat", and became a popular meme in YouTube.

Though Fatso had died in 1987, Schmidt had since adopted two other cats to become the new "Keyboard Cat" and providing video footage to be used for the meme: Bento until his death in 2018, and the new current Keyboard Cat, Skinny.
